# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of Prodigy Infotech ML Internship Task-01.

## Objective
To implement a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on:
- Square Footage (GrLivArea)
- Number of Bedrooms (BedroomAbvGr)
- Number of Bathrooms (FullBath)

## Dataset
Kaggle House Prices Dataset:

## Model Used
Linear Regression

## Results
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Generated in output
- R2 Score: Generated in output
- Graph: Actual vs Predicted House Prices
